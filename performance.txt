1️⃣ Subject-wise Average Marks

Goal: Identify which subjects students perform well in and which are weak areas.

SQL Example
SELECT 
    sub.subject_name,
    AVG(m.marks) AS avg_marks
FROM marks m
JOIN subjects sub ON m.subject_id = sub.subject_id
GROUP BY sub.subject_name;

Pandas Example
df = pd.read_sql("SELECT * FROM marks JOIN subjects USING(subject_id)", conn)
subject_avg = df.groupby("subject_name")["marks"].mean()
print(subject_avg)


Insight:

Teachers can focus on weak subjects.

Compare performance across subjects.

2️⃣ Student-wise Overall Performance

Goal: Rank students based on total or average marks.

SQL Example
SELECT 
    s.student_id,
    s.name,
    AVG(m.marks) AS avg_marks
FROM students s
JOIN marks m ON s.student_id = m.student_id
GROUP BY s.student_id, s.name
ORDER BY avg_marks DESC;

Pandas Example
df = pd.read_sql("SELECT * FROM marks JOIN students USING(student_id)", conn)
student_avg = df.groupby(["student_id", "name"])["marks"].mean().sort_values(ascending=False)
print(student_avg)


Insight:

Identify top and bottom performers.

Helps in reward, guidance, and remedial actions.

3️⃣ Attendance vs Performance Analysis

Goal: Check if low attendance correlates with low marks.

SQL Example
SELECT 
    s.student_id,
    s.name,
    a.attendance_percentage,
    AVG(m.marks) AS avg_marks
FROM students s
JOIN attendance a ON s.student_id = a.student_id
JOIN marks m ON s.student_id = m.student_id
GROUP BY s.student_id, s.name, a.attendance_percentage;

Pandas + Matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df = pd.read_sql("""
SELECT s.student_id, s.name, a.attendance_percentage, m.marks
FROM students s
JOIN attendance a ON s.student_id = a.student_id
JOIN marks m ON s.student_id = m.student_id
""", conn)

df_grouped = df.groupby(["student_id","name","attendance_percentage"])["marks"].mean().reset_index()

plt.scatter(df_grouped["attendance_percentage"], df_grouped["marks"])
plt.xlabel("Attendance %")
plt.ylabel("Average Marks")
plt.title("Attendance vs Average Marks")
plt.show()


Insight:

Identify students at risk due to poor attendance.

Can motivate attendance policies.

4️⃣ Class-wise / Section-wise Performance

Goal: Compare performance of different classes or sections.

SQL Example
SELECT 
    s.class,
    s.section,
    AVG(m.marks) AS avg_marks
FROM students s
JOIN marks m ON s.student_id = m.student_id
GROUP BY s.class, s.section;

Pandas Example
df = pd.read_sql("SELECT * FROM students JOIN marks USING(student_id)", conn)
class_avg = df.groupby(["class", "section"])["marks"].mean()
print(class_avg)


Insight:

Identify classes or sections that are struggling.

Helps allocate extra resources or teachers.

✅ Optional Advanced Analyses

Semester-wise trend: Track improvement or decline over semesters.

Top N students per subject: Identify subject specialists.

Risk analysis: Combine attendance < 70% and avg_marks < 70% to flag students.
